# Machine-Learning
This is my personal notes of the famous Machine Learning by Andrew Ng. I am making this available hoping that this will be helpful for the people who are interested to know about Machine Learning and gain an in-depth idea of it.

I am making them online with the hope that these will prove to be uselful for the people wanting to venture into the amazing world of Machine Learning.

I am very confident that one who goes through these materials will appreciate them and will benefit tons from it.
